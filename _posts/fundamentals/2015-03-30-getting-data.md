meta_description: A tutorial on reliable data sources including Data.gov. Chart Studio is the easiest way to make beautiful graphs online and for free.

Note, if you were redirected here after trying to upload a dataset directly to Chart Studio this is no longer possible.
See our tutorial on [adding data to the plotly grid](/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) for more info on adding data to
Chart Studio. Below is a [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) app built around a
[dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/grain-transportation-report-figure-8) hosted on [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).
It loads the data directly from the source and its
[source code](https://github.com/plotly/simple-example-chart-apps/tree/master/dash-getting-data) is ready to be deployed.
View an [unembedded version of the app](https://dash-simple-apps.plotly.host/dash-getting-data/).
